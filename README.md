# Readme

If you have questions about this week's lab ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems.

## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. Open Jupyter Lab and start a terminal
2. Navigate to the folder you wish to download this lab
3. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/extra-credit.git` and hit the enter key
4. This should download a folder to your local machine with the lab (it should be called `extra-credit`)
5. Launch the desired notebook

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.
